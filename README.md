### **Retail_Transaction-Customer-Behaviour**
This project involves a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of a retail dataset to identify sales trends, customer purchasing behavior, and channel performance. By integrating data from customer demographics, product hierarchies, and transaction logs, I developed a series of advanced PostgreSQL queries to provide actionable business recommendations.
##**Database Description:**
Customers: Contains demographic details such as Gender, DOB, and city_code.
Product Hierarchy: Maps 6 main categories (e.g., Electronics, Books) to 23 specific sub-categories.
Transactions: Records of over 20,000 sales/returns, including total_amt, Tax, and Store_type.
The Business Insights (GitHub/Portfolio)
##** "Key Business Insights"**
High-Risk Channel: While e-Shop generates the highest gross revenue, it also accounts for the highest volume of negative transactions (returns), suggesting a need for better online product visualization.
Core Demographic: Customers aged 25-40 are the primary revenue drivers, specifically in the 'Clothing' and 'Electronics' categories.
Cross-Selling Opportunity: Books have the highest purchase frequency; bundling them with 'Home and Kitchen' items could increase the average basket size.
